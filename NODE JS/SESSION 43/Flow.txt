TO DELETE ONE MOVIE:

TO GIVE A ERROR MESSAGE WHEN THERE IS NO MOVIE:

TO UPDATE ONE MOVIE:

TO MAKE ABOVE NORMAL CODE INTO A FUNCTION:

TO SHOW THE UPDATED MOVIE IN THE POSTMAN RESULT SECTION: 

TO HIDE THE URL OF MONGO DB ATLAS:
    create a .env file
    enter the name of the variable where the url is stored
    followed by the "=" and the "url"
    eg:- variable name = url
    there shouldn't be any space or semicolon
    to not allow the git to track the created file we are going to mention the name of the file in the ".gitignore" file
    to use the created file in our main file we are going to use a package called .ENV
    to install it type "npm i dotenv" in the terminal
    then import the "dotenv" by typing this code in the main page "import dotenv from "dotenv";
    then call the method "dotenv.config()"
    this method will put the data we store in the .env file as key value pair key in the process.env variable 
    there will be lot of thing and our data will also be there as an key value pair
    now to take out the url and store it in a variable
    type in your main file "const MONGO_URL = process.env.MONGO_URL"
    so our url and password in it will be safe when we commit it to the github
    !CONT. TO THE "index.js"
