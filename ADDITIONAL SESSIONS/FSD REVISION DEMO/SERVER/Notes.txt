1 -> DRIVERS VS ORM:
    DRIVERS:
        Drivers helps to connect the node js to the database 
        Eg: mongodb package

    ORM:
        ORM is Object Relationship Mapping, which is also used to connect node js to the 
        database but it is an advanced version of the normal driver like mongodb package. 
        here it has some extra functions to make job easier like "find by id"

        ORM internally uses driver to connect the node js and database
